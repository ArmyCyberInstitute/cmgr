/* EXPLANATION:
 *
 * "char *flag;"
 * `flag` is a "pointer" to a "char" - a signed, single byte numbers which are
 * commonly used to represent text "strings".
 *
 * "char *numbers[10];"
 * `numbers` is an "array" of "char pointers".  An array just means that the
 * type on the left "char *" is repeated a number of times (10 in this case).
 * This is an example of a "static" sized array which means it will always
 * have 10 slots in it.  We can access the slots through the notation
 *     array[index]
 * where "array" is replaced by the variable name (numbers in this case) and
 * "index" is replaced with the position you want to access (starting with 0).
 * In other words, numbers[0] is the first element, numbers[1] is the second,
 * and so on.
 *
 * Under the hood, the compiler & computer convert this into arithmetic
 * composed of applying an offset to the "base" (first element of the array).
 * Going back to "array[index]", the compiler essentially converts this into
 * accessing the memory at (where array_type is the "type" of each element):
 *     array + sizeof(array_type) * index
 * A consequence of this construction is that the compiler and computer
 * allow code like "array[-1]" which will access an "element" immediately
 * before the first.  Accesses like this are frequrently unintentional and
 * can often allow hackers to exploit the program for their own purposes.
 *
 * For this specific instance,
 *     numbers[-1] == flag
 * which should be an early indication of where we should focus our efforts
 * for exploiting this program.
